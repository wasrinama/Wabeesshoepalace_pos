# 🚀 Complete POS System Setup Guide

## Current Status:
✅ Frontend running on: http://localhost:3000  
✅ Backend configured and ready  
⚠️ MongoDB connection needed  

## 🎯 **What to do next:**

### Step 1: Install MongoDB (Choose One Option)

**Option A: Local MongoDB (Recommended for Development)**
1. Download MongoDB Community Edition: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
2. Install and start MongoDB:
   ```bash
   # After installation, start MongoDB
   mongod
   ```

**Option B: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud - No Installation)**
1. Go to https://www.mongodb.com/atlas
2. Create free account
3. Create a cluster
4. Get connection string
5. Update `backend/.env` file with your connection string

### Step 2: Start Backend
Open a **new terminal** and run:
```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```

You should see:
```
Server running on port 5000
Connected to MongoDB
```

### Step 3: Seed Database with Sample Data
In another terminal:
```bash
cd backend
npm run seed
```

This creates:
- **Admin**: username: `admin`, password: `admin123`
- **Manager**: username: `manager1`, password: `mgr123`  
- **Cashier**: username: `cashier1`, password: `cash123`
- Sample products, customers, and suppliers

### Step 4: Test Login
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Try logging in with: `admin` / `admin123`
3. You should see real-time data from the backend!

### Step 5: Real-time Features Working
